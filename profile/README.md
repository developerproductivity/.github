## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ This project aims to develop open-source connectors for analyzing developer productivity. We are currently focusing on a GitHub connector for [Logilica](https://www.logilica.com/).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
